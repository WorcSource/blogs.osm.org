# Feed Policy and Procedures

The configuration file that contains the list of feeds currently used is [planet.ini](planet.ini)

## Relevant feeds

The aggregator should contain articles from blogs by members of the Worcester Source community, and tech firms members work for.

* For personal blogs, we don't mind the content of the blog, the important thing is the blog belongs to a member, regardless of topic.
* We will include Organisation feeds only if a majority of their posts are of interest to mappers, rather than posts about products that contain OpenStreetMap functionality.
* We will remove feeds if the contents are overly spammy (lots of affiliate links and/or low effort).
* We prefer Atom feeds instead of RSS feeds, given the choice.

## Proposing changes

If you want to add a feed, you should open an Issue on this repository. You should provide:

* The name for the blog (usually the name of the person)
* A link to the blog
* A link to the Atom or RSS feed for the blog
* The twitter handle most associated with the blog

If you prefer, you can help us by creating a Pull Request containing the relevant changes to [planet.ini](planet.ini)

If the feed meets the criteria above, it will be added.

If you want to remove a feed, please open an Issue or make a Pull Request describing the change you want to make.
